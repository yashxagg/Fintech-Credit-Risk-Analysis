🏦 Fintech-Credit-Risk-Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of credit risk in the Fintech sector by building an end-to-end classification engine to predict loan default probability. By analyzing historical lending data, I developed a machine learning model that identifies high-risk applicants, helping financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, Numpy), SQL (Window Functions, CTEs for segmenting risk).

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI/Tableau for trend analysis.

Machine Learning: XGBoost/Random Forest, Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE), Hyperparameter Tuning.

Deployment: Streamlit for an interactive "Credit Officer Portal."

🚀 Key Features
Automated Risk Scoring: Real-time prediction of "Default" vs. "Paid" status.

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the top drivers of risk (e.g., Debt-to-Income ratio vs. Annual Income).

Interactive Dashboard: A Streamlit interface with a dynamic "Risk Meter" for individual loan applications.

📈 Business Impact
Precision-Focused: Optimized for "Recall" to ensure that the highest number of potential defaulters are flagged, directly protecting the lender's capital.

Data-Driven Insights: Revealed that [Placeholder for an insight, e.g., "Applicants with DTIs over 30% are 2.5x more likely to default"].
